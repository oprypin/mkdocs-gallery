# Gallery of MkDocs themes

```bash
make setup  # install main dependencies
make build  # will take a long time the first time to install deps
make serve  # go to localhost:8000
```

```bash
python build.py -D  # or --no-deps, to avoid running pip installs
python build.py -T  # or --no-themes, to avoid rebuilding themes
python build.py -S  # or --no-shots, to avoid taking screenshots
```
